    "<h2>Raspberry Pi IoT Ideas</h2>\n",
    "Using Raspberry Pi as open-source hardware, you can build IoT applications that offer any one of the following benefits:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    " \t<li>Enable built-in sensing to build a weather station that measures ambient temperature and humidity</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Build a system that detects discrepancies in electrical readings to identify electricity theft</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Use IoT to build a Servo that is controlled by motion detection readings</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Build a smart control switch that operates devices based on external stimuli. Use this for home automation.</li>\n",

    " \t<li>Build a healthcare monitoring system that tracks, informs, and automatically alerts healthcare providers based on sensor readings that describe a patients vital statistics (like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, etc).</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<h2>IoT Automation Ideas</h2>\n",
    "Almost all new IoT device ideas offer automation benefits, but to outline a few more ideas:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    " \t<li>Build an IoT device that automatically locates and reports the closest nearby parking spot.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Build a motion detection system that automatically issues emails or sms messages to alert home owners of a likely home invasion.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Use temperature sensors connected across the IoT to automatically alert you if your home windows or doors have been left open.</li>\n",
